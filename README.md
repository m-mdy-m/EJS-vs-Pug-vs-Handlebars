## Progressive Enhancement

Box&Reveal HBS is the latest iteration of a practice project aimed at honing server-side rendering skills through progressively enhancing the application's technology stack. What started as a basic HTTP server with static HTML has evolved into a more sophisticated Express.js application. Hereâ€™s how it's developed over time:

- **Version 1**: A simple server using Node.js's HTTP module coupled with HTML for rendering.
- **Version 2**: Introduction of Express.js, enhancing routing and server capabilities.
- **Version 3**: Integration of the Pug template engine, allowing for dynamic content generation.
- **Version 4**: Transition to Handlebars (HBS), modernizing the project with a new templating engine renowned for its logic-less templates and powerful UI building features.

With each step, Box&Reveal HBS has improved its ability to handle data more efficiently, provide a richer user experience, and simplify the development process. This version focuses on utilizing HBS to efficiently manage and display product details while maintaining a clear and flexible codebase.
